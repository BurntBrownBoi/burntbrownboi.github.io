        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>I'm an IT student, Game Development enthusiast and car aficionado</p>
        <p>Passionate about pushing the limits of game engines, mostly Roblox Studio for comedic purposes</p>
        <p>Plan to establish my own Indie game studio at some point in the future!</p>

        <h2>About Section</h2>
        <p>Here, you can learn more about me and my skills.</p>
        <p>Specializing in Game Development, my skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Lua and through my internship
          at the Cincinnati Insurance Companies, I discovered object-oriented programming in C#, TypeScript, XML, and more via
          custom Angular Apps. Growing up, I've always played racing games ranging from Gran Turismo 4 (Absolute GOAT), 
          Forza Horizon 3 which was a well optimized masterpiece for its' time, and just about every need for speed game in existence.
          I've always had a keen eye for how every element in a game is created. From the level design to pixel-peeping at distant objects
          and learning about render distance on my own and how certain optimizations are made just by playing through the game multiple times.
          Currently in Roblox Studio, I am working on two separate games. A simple shooter that follows the trend of "unfinished" or "untitled" games and is nearing completion. 
          The other is an open-world racing game to rival other games on Roblox by having the highest visual fidelity and stability. I already have a name, Veloce!
          I am also a part-time simracer on the weekends, while not official the goal is to be part of a team at some point via my weekend races.
          My love for cars has always tied in with my passion for video games and hopefully, once I finish making Veloce, I will have made a racing game
          that not only pushes Roblox's graphical engine but is well-made and allows car enthusaists everywhere to enjoy an awesome virtual world.
